## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In the previous submission, we received one NOTE regarding a "possibly misspelled word" (`translational`) and encountered installation ERRORS on `R-devel` platforms.

*   We have addressed the NOTE by adding the word `translational` to an `inst/WORDLIST` file, though we have observed that this may still be flagged by some check environments.
*   The installation ERRORS on `R-devel` are due to a known incompatibility between the `later` package (an indirect dependency) and the upcoming `R 4.6.0`. As documented in the original comments, this is not an issue with our package's code and is not expected to affect CRAN's `R-release` builds.

## Test environments

*   **Local:** macOS 14.1 (aarch64), R 4.5.2: **0 errors, 0 warnings, 1 NOTE**
*   **R-hub:** See below for results. We will run `rhub::check_for_cran()`.
*   **win-builder:** We will submit to `r-devel-windows-x86_64`.

The single NOTE is `License stub is invalid DCF`, which is expected and ignorable for packages using the `MIT + file LICENSE` structure.

## R CMD check results

*   **Local `R CMD check`:** `0 errors, 0 warnings, 1 NOTE`.
*   **`R-hub` and `win-builder`:** We are submitting to these services to confirm the package is installable on other platforms, particularly to demonstrate that the `R-devel` issue is isolated and the package is otherwise ready.

The failure on `R-devel` is due to a compilation error in the `later` package (`error: ‘::Rf_rnbeta’ has not been declared`), which is a known issue between `later` and `R-devel`. We have included `later (>= 1.3.1)` in `Imports` as recommended, but a compatible version for `R-devel` may not yet be available on CRAN.
